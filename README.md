# Digital-Image-Processing-using-Matlab
Digital image processing is the use of algorithms and mathematical models to process and analyze digital images. 
The goal of digital image processing is to enhance the quality of images, extract meaningful information from images, and automate image-based tasks.
A digital image is a two-dimensional matrix of two spatial coordinates, with each cell specifying the intensity level of the image at that point. 
So, we have an N x N matrix with integer values ranging from a minimum intensity level of 0 to a maximum level of L-1, where L denotes the number of intensity levels.
Hence, the intensity levels of a pixel r can take on values from 0,1,2,3,â€¦. (L-1). 
Generally, L = 2m, where m is the number of bits required to represent the intensity levels. 
Zero level intensity denotes complete black or dark, whereas L-1 level indicates complete white or absence of grayscale.
